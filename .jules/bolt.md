## 2024-05-20 - Plotly 3D Trace Merging
**Learning:** Plotly's `go.Scatter3d` allows merging disjoint lines using `None` separators, but line coloring requires a numerical array and a valid named `colorscale`. Passing a list of hex strings or a qualitative colorscale name like 'Set3' causes a `ValueError` for the `colorscale` property, unlike in `px` or other contexts.
**Action:** When merging 3D traces with categorical coloring, map categories to integers and use a high-contrast sequential/cyclic colorscale like 'Turbo' or 'Rainbow' if the specific qualitative palette cannot be manually constructed as a valid colorscale object.
