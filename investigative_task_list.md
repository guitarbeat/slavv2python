## Investigation Guidelines

### For Each Task:
1. **Examine the specific code** in context
2. **Check for false positives** in static analysis
3. **Verify dependencies** and usage patterns
4. **Test thoroughly** before making changes
5. **Document decisions** and rationale
6. **Measure impact** of changes

### Risk Assessment:
- **Low Risk**: Removing unused imports, fixing syntax errors
- **Medium Risk**: Consolidating utility functions, removing unused variables
- **High Risk**: Refactoring core functionality, changing module structure

### Success Criteria:
- No functionality is broken
- Code is more maintainable
- Performance is maintained or improved
- Test coverage is adequate
- Documentation is updated

## Next Steps:
1. Start with Priority 1 tasks (critical issues)
2. Move to Priority 2 (code duplication) for high-impact improvements
3. Address Priority 3 (dead code) systematically
4. Plan Priority 4 (organization) for long-term improvements
5. Consider Priority 5 (quality) for ongoing maintenance
