## 📊 Executive status (stage model)

Phase 1 exit criterion: **strict zero** missing/extra per stage via sequential `prove-exact` (energy → vertices → edges → network) on full `180709_E`—not informal match-rate thresholds.

| Stage | Harness / prior work | Phase 1 certification (strict zero) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy** | Native Hessian path exact-compatible | 🟡 Crop rerun active (PID `31796`) after isolating the first remaining crop mismatch to MATLAB `linspace` mesh roundoff plus exact-route raw-intensity preservation. Local one-voxel diagnostic now matches MATLAB; crop energy proof pending rerun completion. |
| **Vertices** | Verified on prior surfaces | ⏳ Pending passing proof on certified run |
| **Edges** | v29 ~88.7% pair match (diagnostic baseline) | ⏳ Pending sequential proof after upstream stages |
| **Network** | End-to-end pipeline runs | ⏳ Pending sequential proof |
| **`prove-exact` energy stage** | ✅ In `EXACT_STAGE_ORDER` (2026-05-28) | Required for R3 gating |

## 🚦 Active Phase 1 operations

| Track | Run / artifact | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Canonical cert** | `workspace/runs/oracle_180709_E/phase1_cert_network` | Pipeline ✅ **complete** through network (2026-05-28). **Blocked on proof:** canonical MATLAB batch has an extensionless HDF5 energy volume, but the promoted oracle is missing normalized `03_Analysis/normalized/oracle/energy.pkl`. Re-promote the oracle before `prove-exact-sequence`. Rerun from energy on the current exact-route branch before proof (old run used pre-fix energy semantics). |
| **Crop harness oracle** | `workspace/oracles/180709_E_crop_M` | ✅ Promoted ([HDF5 energy loader](../../solutions/integration-issues/matlab-v200-energy-hdf5-oracle-loader.md)) |
| **Crop harness run** | `workspace/runs/oracle_180709_E/crop_M_exact` | Python energy rerun active (PID `31796`, recorded in `workspace/scratch/crop_energy_rerun_latest.pid`) after exact-route fixes: MATLAB `uint16` lattice rounding, MATLAB-native Y/X/Z chunk frame, MATLAB `ifftn(...,'symmetric')` emulation, float64 energy storage, `interp3` `Inf` propagation, MATLAB `linspace` mesh roundoff, and raw exact-route intensity preservation. Proof pending rerun completion. |

### Cold-start protocol

If resuming exact parity work from a fresh thread:

1. Check the crop rerun PID in `workspace/scratch/crop_energy_rerun_latest.pid`.
2. If the process is still alive, do not start another writer on `crop_M_exact`.
3. If it has exited, run the crop energy proof first.
4. If energy passes, refresh crop downstream checkpoints with `--force-rerun-from vertices --stop-after network`, then run `prove-exact-sequence`.
5. If crop energy passes, promote the canonical oracle to materialize normalized `energy.pkl`, then rerun canonical from energy when feasible.
6. If any proof fails, inspect the first failing field before changing code.

Scratch diagnostics for the current crop energy hypothesis are indexed in `workspace/scratch/parity_energy_diagnostics.md`.

## 🏆 Historical high-water mark breakthrough (May 2026)

A major architectural breakthrough was achieved in May 2026, dramatically narrowing the discrepancy gap in edge candidate generation.

This section is historical context only. See [Active Phase 1 operations](#-active-phase-1-operations) and [Active blockers](#-active-blockers) for current proof status.

### The Solution: Parameter Alignment & NaN Stability
- **Parameter Alignment (v29)**: Discovered that the MATLAB oracle was generated with `edge_number_tolerance = 4`, while Python was hardcoded to 2. Aligning this parameter allowed high-degree vertices (hubs) to initiate sufficient exploratory traces.
- **NaN Stability**: Fixed a floating-point instability where multiplying `-Inf` (vertex priority) by `0.0` (directional suppression factor) created `NaNs`, leading to incorrect seed selection in subsequent iterations.
- **Precision Alignment (May 22)**: Implemented bit-accurate tie-breaking using exact equality (`==`) and Fortran-order linear index priority. Removed all remaining `float32` casts in the expansion frontier.
- **Tightened Filtering**: Implemented hard distance cutoffs ($d/R > 3.0$) and aligned edge influence sigmas to exactly $2/3$.
- **Outcome**: Successfully reached the **88.7%** match rate milestone (1062/1197 pairs). This remains an informal edge baseline, not the Phase 1 certification bar.

### Historical mathematical impact
| Metric | Previous Baseline (v28) | High-Water Mark (v29) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Matched MATLAB Pairs** | 958 | 1062 |
| **Total Match Rate** | 80.0% | 88.7% |
| Missing Pairs | 239 | 135 |
| Over-generated Pairs | 263 | 371 |

## ⚖️ Exact Parameter Fairness Gate

To guarantee a fair mathematical race, all exact-route experiments must maintain structural lock-step between Python and MATLAB configuration inputs. This is validated via the **Parameter Diffusion Matrix**.

Every compliant proof run maintains three persistent JSON manifests under `01_Params/`:

1. **`shared_params.json`**: The authoritative overlap of settings that must exist in both MATLAB and Python.
2. **`python_derived_params.json`**: Internal Python-only pipeline management levers.
3. **`param_diff.json`**: The cryptographic hash bridge that proves zero illicit divergence occurred between the split configuration states.

### Locked Mathematical Constants
The audit system mandates these exact value bindings (derived from source-hardcoded MATLAB constants):
- `step_size_per_origin_radius = 1.0`
- `max_edge_energy = 0.0`
- `distance_tolerance_per_origin_radius = 3.0`
- `edge_number_tolerance = 4` (Corrected from 2)

## 🛠️ Verified Infrastructure Fixes

The core codebase has absorbed the following permanent fixes, ensuring structural stability:

*   ✅ **Exact-route intensity scale**: Skip min-max normalization and ignore `intensity_limits` clipping when `comparison_exact_network=True`, preserving the raw TIFF/HDF5 values used by the MATLAB crop oracle (2026-06-02).
*   ✅ **Energy downsample stride phase**: `_downsample_volume` uses MATLAB `get_starts_and_counts_V200` last-chunk alignment `start = (size-1) mod rf` per axis (whole-volume single chunk). Verified analytically (rf=9 → start 3; rf=20 → start 15) and empirically (origin energy −20.3757) (2026-05-29).
*   ✅ **HDF5 scale-index base**: `matlab_vector_loader` reads MATLAB global scale subscripts as 1-based (`one_based=True`), converting e.g. 91→90 for Python 0-based indexing (2026-05-29).
*   ✅ **Energy axis permutation**: `energy_axis_permutation` param permutes `microns_per_voxel` and `pixels_per_sigma_PSF` to the working image axis order so per-axis resolution factors map to the correct dimensions; added to `EXACT_ALLOWED_ORCHESTRATION_PARAMETER_KEYS` (2026-05-29).
*   ✅ **Upsample/`interp3` coordinate consistency**: exact-route chunk mesh uses MATLAB `get_energy_V202` local ranges and `mod(offset, rf)/rf` coordinates for each writing chunk (2026-06-02).
*   ✅ **MATLAB `interp3` invalid-neighbor semantics**: exact-route interpolation now propagates positive-weight `Inf` coarse-energy neighbors instead of finite-only reweighting, matching MATLAB's false-candidate suppression at downsampled octave boundaries (2026-06-02).
*   ✅ **MATLAB `linspace` mesh roundoff**: exact-route chunk meshes use MATLAB-style `linspace` endpoints rather than arithmetic `arange / rf`; this preserves tiny fractional drift such as `9.000000000000002`, which changes `interp3` `Inf` propagation at octave boundaries (2026-06-02).
*   ✅ **Double-Precision Energy Alignment**: Forced all core watershed maps (`energy_map_temp`, `vertex_energies`) and neighborhood penalty calculations to `float64`. This prevents precision-induced tie-breaking divergences where `float32` would collapse distinct energy values into identical bits, causing different seed selections than MATLAB's `double`.
*   ✅ **Bit-Accurate Tie-Breaking**: Replaced `np.isclose` with exact bitwise equality and added linear index priority to the frontier priority queue, matching MATLAB's hub vertex exploration behavior.
*   ✅ **Hard Distance Cutoff**: Implemented the MATLAB-exact $d/R > 3.0$ expansion cutoff in the watershed loop.
*   ✅ **Edge Influence Alignment**: Updated default `sigma_per_influence_edges` to $2/3$, aligning with MATLAB's conflict painting regions.
*   ✅ **Stable Frontier Splicing**: Verified and anchored the `available_locations` insertion logic to mirror MATLAB's `find(..., 'last')` and `find(..., 'first')` behavior, ensuring stable FIFO/LIFO handling for identical energy seeds.
*   ✅ **Backtracking Pointer Correction**: Fixed reverse-index logic, allowing trace recovery back to the origin vertex.
*   ✅ **Stable Discovery Sorting**: Forces deterministic processing orders matching MATLAB's explicit energy quality sorting.
*   ✅ **Trace Order Randomization**: Anchored native shuffling to a stable, reproducible seeded RNG generator.
*   ✅ **Distance Normalization (r/R)**: Corrected physical energy penalties to scale relatively to the vessel's radius ($R$).
*   ✅ **Strel Offset Alignment**: Realigned watershed structuring element (strel) offsets and loops to match the (Z, X, Y) universe layout, fixing major distance-penalty errors.
*   ✅ **Filtering Logic Reordering**: Realigned the cleanup sequence (Crop first $\rightarrow$ Pair Cleanup second) to protect valid pairs from phantom blocking.

## 🚀 Active blockers

1. **Crop harness energy proof — current rerun pending** — The completed PID `30880` rerun reduced the crop gap to 9,095 scale mismatches; the first remaining mismatch at Python `(z=0,y=0,x=27)` was traced to two exact-route issues: arithmetic mesh coordinates missed MATLAB `linspace` roundoff, and exact-route preprocessing still clipped raw intensities with `intensity_limits`. A one-voxel MATLAB/Python diagnostic now matches the MATLAB winner (scale 54, energy `-12.028384150742127`). Fresh rerun PID `31796` is active. **Next:** when the rerun completes, run `prove-exact --stage energy` first and inspect the first failing proof surface if any.
2. **Canonical oracle energy artifact** — `180709_E_batch_190910-103039` promoted oracle lacks normalized `energy.pkl`, but its MATLAB batch has the extensionless HDF5 energy companion (`data/energy_190910-103039_*`, shape `(2, 64, 512, 512)`). Re-run `promote-oracle` from the canonical batch before tier-3 proof.
3. **Canonical run re-execution** — `phase1_cert_network` completed with pre-fix energy semantics. Rerun from energy on the current exact-route branch before any canonical proof claim.
4. **Sequential strict-zero closure** — After energy passes on a run, prove vertices → edges → network in order. v29 **135 missing / 371 extra** pairs remain the informal edges baseline until `prove-exact --stage edges` reports zero.

**Superseded guidance:** “>95% match” or “prove-exact once parity exceeds 95%” is not the Phase 1 bar. Use strict zero per stage only.
