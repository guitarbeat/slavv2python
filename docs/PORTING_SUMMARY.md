# SLAVV Python/Streamlit Implementation - Enhanced Version

> Update (current): Fixed core syntax/logic issues in `vectorization_core.py`; standardized radii handling; corrected Hessian sigma usage; repaired Streamlit stats/visualization bindings; ensured energy field slice visualization; added surface area and tortuosity statistics; seeded edge tracing with local Hessian-based vessel directions; introduced a sign-aware watershed-based edge extraction alternative with regression tests verifying boundary detection; added CASX and VMV network import helpers to finalize I/O parity; expanded edge visualizations with radius coloring, depth-based opacity, edge-length coloring, and colorbars for edge metrics alongside existing depth, energy, and strand options; introduced cross-sectional slice visualization for interactive inspection; locked 2D projections and slices to equal axis scales for accurate physical proportions; **added animated strand playback for sequential 3D visualization and flow-field rendering of edge orientations**; documented known deviations in [PARITY_DEVIATIONS.md](PARITY_DEVIATIONS.md); introduced a regression fixture for synthetic edge tracing; added robust TIFF upload handling with descriptive errors for invalid or corrupted files; introduced uncurated info extraction for QA datasets; added CSV-based training workflows for ML curation; provided tooltips across Streamlit parameters and metrics for improved guidance; strengthened parameter validation with explicit range checks; and added 3D input validation with graceful handling of empty vertices and edges; introduced progress callbacks to report pipeline stage completion while surfacing stepwise updates in the Streamlit processing page; added a profiling helper to measure pipeline performance; and accelerated gradient evaluations with optional Numba JIT. Added memory-mapped TIFF loading to conserve RAM when handling large volumes. Parity gaps remain in detailed energy kernel/PSF weighting and MATLAB regression validation compared to `get_energy_V202.m`, `get_vertices_V200.m`, and `get_edges_V300.m`.
Optimized energy-field calculation to avoid retaining all per-scale volumes unless explicitly requested, reducing memory usage for large datasets.
Added optional scikit-image Frangi and Sato paths (`energy_method='frangi'` or `'sato'`) for faster vesselness filtering.
Added a regression test verifying chunking lattice recombination to ensure tiling correctness.
Configured a GitHub Actions workflow to run compilation checks and tests on each commit.

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the SLAVV (Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization) Python/Streamlit implementation based on your feedback regarding port completeness, parameter transparency, and user interface enhancements.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. üîç Complete MATLAB Analysis and Port

Note: Recent verification steps cross-checked behavior with original MATLAB functions (e.g., `get_energy_V202.m`, `get_vertices_V200.m`, `get_edges_V300.m`). The Python implementation remains a simplified, working port; exact numerical parity is not yet guaranteed for those components.

**What was done:**
- Thoroughly analyzed the original MATLAB `vectorize_V200.m` file
- Examined all source files in the `source/` directory including:
  - `MLDeployment.py` - Machine learning deployment functionality
  - `MLLibrary.py` - Core ML algorithms and utilities
  - `MLTraining.py` - Training procedures and validation
  - `pythonSetup.py` - Python environment configuration

**Improvements:**
- **Complete Algorithm Implementation**: Fully implemented the 4-step SLAVV algorithm in Python:
  1. Energy image formation with multi-scale Hessian filtering
  2. Vertex extraction via local minima detection with volume exclusion
  3. Edge extraction through gradient descent tracing
  4. Network construction with connected component analysis

- **PSF Correction**: Implemented the Zipfel et al. point spread function model with proper coefficient selection based on numerical aperture
- **Multi-scale Processing**: Full implementation of scale-space analysis with configurable scales per octave
- **Vesselness Enhancement**: Frangi/Sato-like vesselness measures for tubular structure detection
- **Cropping Helpers**: Added bounding-box and mask-based utilities to filter vertices and edges, matching `crop_vertices_V200.m` and related helpers

### 2. üìè Parameter Transparency and Validation

**Excitation Wavelength Parameter:**
- **Issue Addressed**: You asked about the "‚â§ 3 Œºm" constraint on excitation wavelength
- **Finding**: The MATLAB code validates that `excitation_wavelength_in_microns` is a positive numeric scalar, but does not enforce a hard upper limit of 3 Œºm
- **Implementation**: Added validation with warning for values outside the typical two-photon microscopy range (0.7-3.0 Œºm)
- **Explanation**: The 3 Œºm limit likely comes from practical considerations for two-photon microscopy rather than algorithmic constraints

**Enhanced Parameter Interface:**
- **Comprehensive Parameter Tabs**: Organized parameters into logical groups:
  - üî¨ Microscopy: Voxel sizes, PSF parameters, optical properties
  - üìè Vessel Sizes: Radius ranges and scale configuration
  - ‚öôÔ∏è Processing: Energy thresholds, spatial parameters
  - üî¨ Advanced: Fine-tuning parameters for expert users

- **Real-time Validation**: Parameters are validated with immediate feedback
- **Contextual Help**: Each parameter includes detailed tooltips explaining its purpose
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Shows computed values (e.g., number of scales) based on parameter settings
- **Descriptive Errors**: Out-of-range values raise clear messages with suggested ranges

### 3. üé® Comprehensive User Interface Enhancement

**Modern Web Interface:**
- **Professional Styling**: Custom CSS with consistent color scheme and typography
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Navigation**: Sidebar navigation with clear page organization
 - **Progress Indicators**: Real-time processing progress with stage-specific updates

**Enhanced Functionality:**
- **Multi-page Architecture**: 
  - üè† Home: Overview and quick start guide
  - ‚öôÔ∏è Image Processing: Complete parameter interface and processing pipeline
  - ü§ñ ML Curation: Machine learning-based quality control
  - üìä Visualization: Interactive 2D/3D network rendering
  - üìà Analysis: Comprehensive statistical analysis
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è About: Algorithm background and technical details

**Advanced Visualization:**
- **Interactive Plots**: Plotly-based 2D and 3D network visualizations
- **Multiple Color Schemes**: Energy, depth, strand ID, radius-based coloring across both 2D and 3D views
- **Slice Views**: Cross-sectional network visualization with adjustable thickness
- **Statistical Dashboards**: Comprehensive network analysis with multiple chart types
- **Export Capabilities**: Multiple format support (VMV, CASX, CSV, JSON)

### 4. ü§ñ Machine Learning Integration

**Complete ML Curator Implementation:**
- **Feature Extraction**: Comprehensive feature sets for vertices and edges:
  - Energy statistics and local neighborhood properties
  - Geometric features (length, tortuosity, connectivity)
  - Spatial position and gradient information
  - Radius-to-scale and energy-to-local-mean ratios
  - Endpoint radii metrics and length-to-radius ratios for edges
  - Multi-scale characteristics
