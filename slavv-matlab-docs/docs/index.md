# SLAVV MATLAB Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the original SLAVV (Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization) MATLAB project.

This documentation is automatically generated from the MATLAB source code using `mkdocstrings` and the `mkdocstrings-matlab` handler.

To build and view these docs locally, run `mkdocs serve` from within the `slavv-matlab-docs` directory.
## Core Functionality

Below is the documentation for the main `vectorize_V200.m` script, which contains the core SLAVV algorithm.
