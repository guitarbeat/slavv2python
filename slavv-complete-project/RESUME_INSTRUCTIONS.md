# How to Resume the SLAVV Project

This document provides instructions on how to resume the SLAVV (Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization) project from its current state in a new sandbox environment.

## Current Project State

The project is a Python/Streamlit implementation of the SLAVV algorithm. The core functionality from the original MATLAB repository has been ported, and the user interface has been significantly enhanced. However, there was a persistent issue with f-string syntax in the `app.py` file, specifically within the `show_analysis_page` function, which was preventing the application from running correctly in the previous session. This issue was being actively debugged when the sandbox environment became unresponsive.

## Remaining Tasks

1.  **Resolve `app.py` f-string syntax errors**: The primary remaining task is to fix the f-string syntax errors in the `show_analysis_page` function within `app.py`. This was the last active debugging point.
2.  **Test and validate the updated application**: Once the syntax errors are resolved, thoroughly test the Streamlit application to ensure all functionalities (Image Processing, ML Curation, Visualization, Analysis) are working as expected.
3.  **Deliver the improved application and comparison file to the user**: After successful testing, provide the user with the updated application and the `SOURCE_DIRECTORY_COMPARISON.md` file.

## How to Resume in a New Chat

Follow these steps to set up the project in a new sandbox environment and continue working on it:

1.  **Download the attached `slavv-streamlit-current-state.zip` file.** This zip file contains the entire project directory as it was at the end of the previous session.

2.  **Start a new chat session.**

3.  **Upload the `slavv-streamlit-current-state.zip` file to the new sandbox environment.** You can typically do this by dragging and dropping the file into the chat interface or using an upload button if available.

4.  **Unzip the project files.** Once uploaded, use the following shell command to unzip the project:
    ```bash
    unzip /home/ubuntu/slavv-streamlit-current-state.zip -d /home/ubuntu/
    ```
    This will extract the `slavv-streamlit` directory to `/home/ubuntu/`.

5.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/slavv-streamlit
    ```

6.  **Install the required Python dependencies.** It's crucial to install all necessary libraries for the Streamlit app to run correctly. Use the `requirements.txt` file for this:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7.  **Continue debugging and testing.** Your primary focus should be on resolving the f-string syntax errors in `app.py`. You can use the `file_read` tool to inspect the `app.py` file, specifically around line 687 (or the `show_analysis_page` function), and then use `file_replace_text` to correct the syntax.

    After making changes, you can run the Streamlit app to test:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0 &
    ```
    And then expose the port:
    ```bash
    service_expose_port(port=8501)
    ```
    You can then navigate to the provided URL in your browser to see the application.

8.  **Refer to `SOURCE_DIRECTORY_COMPARISON.md` and `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`:** These files (also included in the zip) provide context on the changes made and the comparison with the original MATLAB repository.

By following these steps, you should be able to seamlessly pick up where we left off and complete the remaining tasks. Good luck!




## Known Issue: `tree-sitter` and `mkdocstrings-matlab`

During the attempt to generate MATLAB documentation, a persistent `ImportError: cannot import name 'QueryCursor' from 'tree_sitter'` was encountered. This is a known compatibility issue between `mkdocstrings-matlab` and certain versions of `tree-sitter`. Despite attempts to install `build-essential` and `python3-dev` to resolve compilation errors, and trying different `tree-sitter` versions, the issue persisted. This suggests a deeper incompatibility or an environment-specific build problem.

If you wish to continue with MATLAB documentation generation in a new environment, you might need to:
- Experiment with different `tree-sitter` versions.
- Ensure all build tools and Python development headers are correctly installed and discoverable by the build process.
- Consult the `mkdocstrings-matlab` and `tree-sitter` documentation for specific environment setup requirements or known compatibility matrices.

For now, the MATLAB documentation generation process is halted due to this technical blocker. The primary focus for resuming the task should be on fixing the Streamlit application's f-string errors as outlined above.
